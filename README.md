# Rock-Paper-and-Scissors-with-React

## My First React and AWS project 
This is a simple implementation of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors" built using React and AWS services. The game allows users to play against the computer by selecting their move (rock, paper, or scissors) and seeing the outcome of the game

## Technologies Used
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- AWS Services: Amazon Cognito, AWS Lambda, and API Gateway for authentication and backend functionality.
- AWS Amplify: A development framework for simplifying the integration of AWS services into React applications.
- HTML and CSS: Used for structuring and styling the user interface.


## Features
- User Authentication: The game utilizes Amazon Cognito for user authentication, allowing players to create accounts, sign in, and securely play the game.
- Real-time Gameplay: Users can play against the computer in real-time, with the game logic running on the backend and providing immediate feedback on the outcome.
- Interactive User Interface: The game features a user-friendly interface that allows players to easily select their move and view the results of each round.
- Scalable Backend: The backend of the game is powered by AWS Lambda and API Gateway, ensuring scalability and high performance even during peak usage.

## Setup and Deployment
1) Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2) Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.
3) Configure your AWS credentials and region in the project files.
4) Set up the required AWS services, including Amazon Cognito, AWS Lambda, and API Gateway.
5) Update the frontend configuration with your AWS credentials and API endpoints.
6) Run the application locally using `npm start` for testing and development. Access the game at http://localhost:5173/.
7) Deploy the application to a hosting platform, such as AWS S3 or AWS Amplify Console, for production deployment.
